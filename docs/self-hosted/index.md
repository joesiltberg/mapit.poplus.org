title: Self-hosted MapIt

Technical Overview
------------------

The `mapit` directory contains a standard [GeoDjango] app, and the `project`
directory contains an example GeoDjango project using that app. Other top-level
things are mostly to fit within mySociety's standard deployment, or country
specific data, one-off scripts and so on.

MapIt has been installed on Debians from lenny to stretch, and on Ubuntu from
10.04 onwards. If GeoDjango and [PostGIS] run on it, it should theoretically be
okay; do let us know of any problems.

Installation
------------

MapIt can be installed as a Django app, or as a standalone server. For full
details, see the [installation documentation](install/).

Importing data
--------------

There are various ways to import data into MapIt, ranging from manually to
importing KML files. We have also supplied notes for some of the countries
that MapIt has been set up for; see the links in the navigation.
